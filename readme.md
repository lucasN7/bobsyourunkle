# Lucas attemp at Unkle's backend use case in Django

## Bonjour! 

And welcome to Lucas' attempt to implement Unkle backend use case. It's called Bob's your uncle in reference to the [idiom](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Bob%27s%20your%20uncle) I've recently learnt and I like , and... Unkle.

I chose English to write the entire project because		
- I think it's good practice to write code and comments in English, you never know when you'll become a successfull international webapp??
- My laptop is Aussie so my keyboard is still a QWERTY => French accents are a pain right now ^_^'

## Stack

1. Django: 3.2.12 => seems to be the best compromise between stability and features (tried 4.0.x but straight up gave me some difficulties)
2. Python: 3.8 => seems to work well with Django 3.2.12 (from my short experience)
3. Database: Sqlite => easy to get going for you to test even if I prefer Postgres
4. Testing: Postman => I quite like it and I'm used to it

## Author's way to run the project
1. Install a Python 3.8 virtual environment and install libraries from the requirements.txt (>> pip install -r requirements.txt)
2. Initialize the database: COMMANDE TODO
3. Create a super-user (>> python manage.py create_superuser) 
4. Import the postman collection TODO WHERE, authenticate with your superuser (TODO which call)
